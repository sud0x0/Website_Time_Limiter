# Website Time Limiter

Important Note: This tool is not production-ready. The code has not been optimised, and there are security issues. I may not finalise this, as it satisfies my requirement for now. 

## Features
- Limits the time for given domains per day.
- Can reset the time limit if required. However, the number of resets is displayed for each domain. 
- Contains an allow-list function to allow-list specific URLs related to the given domains. The time spent on those URLs will not be tracked.
